# detroit-craftsman-evercraft-kata
My implementation of the EverCraft kata, as introduced to me at the Detroit Craftsman Guild meet up. http://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Craftsman-Guild/

EverCraft was developed by Guy Royse @guyroyse and George Walters II @walterg2. Details of the exercise can be found at https://github.com/guyroyse/evercraft-kata.

For my imlementation I used a global intall of jasmine-node. Typically:

```
npm install jasmine-node -g
```

To execute the test suite:

```
jasmine-node .
```
