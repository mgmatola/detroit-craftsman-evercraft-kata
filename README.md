# detroit-craftsman-evercraft-kata
My JavaScript implementation of the EverCraft kata, as introduced to me at the Detroit Craftsman Guild meet up. http://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Craftsman-Guild/

EverCraft was developed by Guy Royse [@guyroyse](https://twitter.com/#!/guyroyse) and George Walters II [@walterg2](https://twitter.com/#!/walterg2). Details of the exercise can be found at https://github.com/guyroyse/evercraft-kata.

For my implementation I used a global install of jasmine-node. Typically:

```
npm install jasmine-node -g
```

To execute the test suite:

```
jasmine-node .
```
